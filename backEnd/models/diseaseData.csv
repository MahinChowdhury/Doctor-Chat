Dense breast tissue
The female hormone oestrogen can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to grow.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
Research shows that women who take the contraceptive pill have a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer
If you have experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer.
Drinking alcohol increases the risk of getting breast cancer.
Certain medical procedures that use radiation, such as X-rays and CT scans, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer."," There are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery:

breast-conserving surgery, where the cancerous lump (tumour) is removed
mastectomy, where the whole breast is removed

breast radiotherapy – after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue
chest-wall radiotherapy – after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall
breast boost – some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, this may affect the appearance of your breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of breast tissue (fibrosis)
radiotherapy to the lymph nodes – where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be in the lymph nodes

Chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medicine to kill cancer cells.

Hormone therapy lowers the levels of oestrogen or progesterone hormones in your body or stops their effects.

Targeted therapies are medicines that change the way cells work and help to stop cancer from growing and spreading. Not all types of breast cancer can be treated with targeted therapies

CKD can be caused by:

high blood pressure – over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly
diabetes – too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys
high cholesterol – this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly

Radon is a natural radioactive gas that comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings.
Exposure to certain chemicals and substances which are used in several occupations and industries may increase your risk of developing lung cancer.",Radiotherapy uses pulses of radiation to destroy cancer cells. There are a number of ways it can be used to treat lung cancer. There are 3 main types of lung cancer surgery: lobectomy – where 1 of the large parts of the lung (lobes) is removed. Your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in 1 section of 1 lung. pneumonectomy – where the entire lung is removed. This is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung. wedge resection or segmentectomy – where a small piece of the lung is removed. This procedure is only suitable for a small number of patients. It is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung. This is usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicine to treat cancer. Immunotherapy is a group of medicines that stimulate your immune system to target and kill cancer cells. It can be used on its own or combined with chemotherapy. Targeted therapies (also known as biological therapies) are medicines designed to slow the spread of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Hormonal issues in the mother, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid problems, can contribute to miscarriage.
Certain infections, like rubella, can increase the risk of miscarriage.
Structural problems in the uterus can make it difficult for a pregnancy to be carried to term.
Smoking, alcohol, and drug use can increase the risk of miscarriage.
The risk of miscarriage increases with maternal age, especially after the age of 35.
Conditions like diabetes and autoimmune disorders can increase the risk of miscarriage.","Sometimes, the body expels the pregnancy naturally. In this case, you may not need any medical intervention but should still be monitored by a healthcare provider.
Your doctor may prescribe medication to help your body expel the pregnancy tissue.
If you've experienced multiple miscarriages or have other risk factors, your doctor may recommend further testing to identify any underlying causes and develop a plan for future pregnancies.
If the miscarriage is incomplete or if there are complications, a surgical procedure known as a dilation and curettage (D&C) may be performed.
Coping with a miscarriage can be emotionally challenging. It's essential to seek emotional support from loved ones, support groups, or mental health professionals."

Radiotherapy involves using radiation to kill cancerous cells.
Brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where the radiation dose is delivered inside the prostate gland. It's also known as internal or interstitial radiotherapy.
Hormone therapy is often used in combination with radiotherapy. For example, you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of successful treatment.
Trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
TURP is a procedure that can help relieve pressure from the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your penis (urethra) to treat any problematic symptoms you may have with urination.
High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
HIFU is sometimes used to treat localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate.
Cryotherapy is a method of killing cancer cells by freezing them. It's sometimes used to treat localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate gland.
Chemotherapy is often used to treat prostate cancer that's spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer).
