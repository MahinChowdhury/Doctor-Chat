medicines for mild allergic reactions like antihistamines, steroid tablets and steroid creams
emergency medicines called adrenaline auto-injectors, such as an EpiPen, for severe allergic reactions
desensitisation (immunotherapy) for severe allergic reactions – this involves carefully exposing you to the thing you're allergic to over time, so your body gradually gets used to it and does not react so badly (this should only be done by a medical professional)"
"a whistling sound when breathing (wheezing) breathlessness
a tight chest, which may feel like a band is tightening around it
coughing",Asthma,"Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) of the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. This makes the tubes highly sensitive, so they temporarily narrow.","Asthma is usually treated by using an inhaler, a small device that lets you breathe in medicines."

aching muscles
headache
a cough or shortness of breath",Bird-flu,"Bird flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird (dead or alive).

a noticeable lump over a bone
a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal
problems moving around – for example, walking with a limp",Bone Cancer, ,"Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.

surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed, but amputation is sometimes necessary
chemotherapy – treatment with powerful cancer-killing medicine
radiotherapy – where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells"
"tiredness
swollen ankles, feet or hands
shortness of breath

blood in your pee (urine)",Kidney Disease,"Chronic kidney disease is usually caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys. Often it's the result of a combination of different problems.

CKD can be caused by:

high blood pressure – over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly
diabetes – too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys
high cholesterol – this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly
kidney infections
glomerulonephritis – kidney inflammation
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease – an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys
blockages in the flow of urine – for example, from kidney stones that keep coming back, or an enlarged prostate
long-term, regular use of certain medicines – such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)","Most kidney stones are small enough to be passed in your pee, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication.

abdominal cramp or pelvic cramp

back pain or pain in the lower abdomen

Hormonal issues in the mother, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid problems, can contribute to miscarriage.
Certain infections, like rubella, can increase the risk of miscarriage.
Structural problems in the uterus can make it difficult for a pregnancy to be carried to term.
Smoking, alcohol, and drug use can increase the risk of miscarriage.
The risk of miscarriage increases with maternal age, especially after the age of 35.
Conditions like diabetes and autoimmune disorders can increase the risk of miscarriage.","Sometimes, the body expels the pregnancy naturally. In this case, you may not need any medical intervention but should still be monitored by a healthcare provider.
Your doctor may prescribe medication to help your body expel the pregnancy tissue.
If you've experienced multiple miscarriages or have other risk factors, your doctor may recommend further testing to identify any underlying causes and develop a plan for future pregnancies.
If the miscarriage is incomplete or if there are complications, a surgical procedure known as a dilation and curettage (D&C) may be performed.
Coping with a miscarriage can be emotionally challenging. It's essential to seek emotional support from loved ones, support groups, or mental health professionals."

Vaccines that protect against Hib are offered to babies as part of the NHS vaccination schedule.

The main treatment for a Hib infection is antibiotics. You'll usually need to be treated in hospital.
You may be given oxygen and other medicines such as steroids, depending on your symptoms. Other treatments, including surgery, may also be needed.
If you have a Hib infection, your close contacts, such as anyone you live with, may be offered antibiotics to stop them getting ill.
